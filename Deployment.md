# üöÄ Deployment Flow Overview
This guide outlines the steps to deploy and securely connect to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) private cluster using Cloud Shell with VNet integration, following a hub-and-spoke network topology.


 ## Access Options Flow 
For the purpose of this demonstration, access to the AKS private cluster will be established using Access Option 3.   

![Architecture Diagram](images/Flow%20Connecting%20to%20an%20AKS%20Private%20Cluster.png)


## üß± Existing Infrastructure 
- Using a Free Azure Subscription 
- Owner role already assigned on the subscription. 
- Hub & spoke Network Topology is already configured:
    - *Hub VNet*:  Hosts Cloud Shell (VNet-integrated).
    - *Spoke VNet*: Hosts the AKS Private Cluster.
    - *VNet Peering*: Established between Hub and Spoke VNets.


## ‚ò∏Ô∏è AKS Private Cluster Deployment

To deploy the AKS private cluster with a private API server endpoint, follow these steps in the Azure Portal:  

**1. Navigate to AKS Service**    
   - Go to the Azure Portal and search for Kubernetes services, then click Create.

**2. Configure Basics**
  - Fill in the required fields such as:
    -  Subscription  
    -  Resource Group  
    -  Cluster name   
    -  Region

**3. Click "Next" Until You Reach the Networking Tab**   
Proceed through the tabs (Node Pools, Authentication, etc.) until you reach Networking.   

![Create Private AKS Cluster](images/Create%20Kubernetes%20cluster%20-%202.png)


**4. Enable Private Access**  
  - In the Networking tab:
     - Check Enable private cluster (Note: The option Public access - Set authorized IP ranges will be greyed out) 
     - If you have already created an Azure Virtual Network, you may choose to use it by selecting the **Bring your own VNet** option. Otherwise, leave it unchecked to allow Azure to automatically create a new Virtual Network for the cluster. 
     - Optionally configure DNS name prefix or leave it to be auto-created.   
     - Review + Create   

![Create Private AKS Cluster](images/Create%20Kubernetes%20cluster%20-%203.png)

**5. Edit the name of Infrastructure Resource Group** 
- In Advanced tab:   
   - If you need to modify the name of infrastructure resource group of AKS, click on Edit and change the name.      

**6. Click Review + Create, validate the configuration, and then click Create to deploy the cluster.**   

## What looks like Infrastructure Resource Group Resources

The following resources are provisioned as part of the AKS cluster deployment. 

![Infrastructure Resource Group](images/Private-EndpointAKS.png)


## üîó  Link Hub VNet (VNet where Cloud Shell ACI will be deployed) to Private DNS Zone   
**1. Locate the AKS Private DNS Zone**
- Go to Private DNS Zones in Azure Portal.
- The zone name will look like: privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io (e.g., privatelink.northeurope.azmk8s.io)

**2. Link the Hub VNet in my case to the Private DNS Zone**
- In the Private DNS Zone:
  - Under DNS Management ‚Üí Virtual Network Links
  - Click + Add
    
![Link Virtual Network to Private DNS Zone](images/Link-hub-vnet-to-private-dns-zone.png)

 
- Enter a Link Name (e.g., dnslink-vnet-hub)
- Select the Hub VNet from the dropdown
- Choose whether to enable Auto-registration (usually disabled for AKS)
- Click Create

## üîß Prerequisites for Cloud Shell VNet Integration
To configure Azure Cloud Shell with Virtual Network integration, the following components must be provisioned:

- **Network Profile**: Defines the network configuration for the Cloud Shell container, including subnet and IP settings.
- **Azure Relay Namespace**: Facilitates secure communication between the Cloud Shell container and Customer Browser.
- **File Share (Storage Account)**: Used to persist Cloud Shell session data across restarts. 


![Required config resources](images/required-resources-for-cloudshell-integration.png)

**PS: The above resources are automatically deployed via the ARM Template Azure Cloud Shell,except the File Share that should be deployed manually.**
üëâ **Important:
Please make sure to check the section "Deploy Azure Relay Namespace" for additional deployment steps and configuration details.**

   In the top search bar, type Storage Accounts and select it.  
     
   **3. Click "Create"**
   Click the + Create button to start the wizard.  
     
   **4. Fill in the Basics:**
    
   - Subscription: Select your active subscription.
   - Resource Group: A resource group where you will have Storage account and Azure Relay namespace.
   - Storage Account Name: Enter a globally unique name (e.g., hubstorageaccount).
   - Region: Select North Europe.
   - Performance: Standard.
   - Redundancy: Choose Locally-redundant storage (LRS). (Unless you need high availability but for the sake of this demo I used LRS)
   - Click "Review + Create", then Create
   - Azure will validate the configuration and deploy the storage account.

   **4. Creation in Progress**
   Your file share will be created and ready for use.


### Register resource providers [Check links](Resources.md)
Cloud Shell needs access to certain Azure resources. You make that access available through resource providers. The following resource providers must be registered in your subscription:

- Microsoft.CloudShell
- Microsoft.ContainerInstance
- Microsoft.Relay

Depending on when your tenant was created, some of these providers might already be registered.

To see all resource providers and the registration status for your subscription:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. On the Azure portal menu, search for Subscriptions. Select it from the available options.
3. Select the subscription that you want to view.
4. On the left menu, under Settings, select **Resource providers**.
5. In the search box, enter **cloudshell** to search for the resource provider.
6. Select the **Microsoft.CloudShell** resource provider from the provider list.
7. Select **Register** to change the status from unregistered to registered.
8. Repeat the previous steps for the **Microsoft.ContainerInstance** and **Microsoft.Relay** resource providers.

### Get The Azure container instance ID

The Azure container instance ID is a unique value for every tenant. 

1. Sign in to the Azure portal. From the home page, select **Microsoft Entra ID**. If the icon isn't displayed, enter Microsoft Entra ID in the top search bar.

2. On the left menu, select **Overview**. Then enter **azure container instance service** in the search bar.

3. In the results, under **Enterprise applications**, select **Azure Container Instance Service**.

### Deploy Azure Relay Namespace

The Azure Relay namespace, along with all required network components and authorization settings, will be deployed automatically using an ARM Template.  
- To deploy these resources into your Azure subscription, use the link below:

[üîó Deploy via Azure Cloud Shell ‚Äì VNet Quickstart Template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/cloud-shell-vnet/)

- Click on **Deploy to Azure**

![DeployCloudShell ARM](images/cloudshell-ARM.png)

- When deploying Azure Cloud Shell ARM ensure that you:

   - Provide the required information, including the name of the existing VNet you deployed.
   - Use the same resource group for both the Storage Account (created in earlier steps) and the Azure Cloud Shell ‚Äì VNet deployment.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
If the Storage Account and VNet are not in the same resource group, Cloud Shell will not be able to associate the VNet with the Storage Account, and the configuration will fail.

### Configure Cloud Shell within the Hub VNet (or VNet of your choice that is peered to AKS VNet)
### Use Cloud Shell to securely connect to the AKS private endpoint
