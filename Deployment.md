# üöÄ Deployment Flow Overview
This guide outlines the steps to deploy and securely connect to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) private cluster using Cloud Shell with VNet integration, following a hub-and-spoke network topology.

 ## Access Options Flow 
For the purpose of this demonstration, access to the AKS private cluster will be established using Access Option 3.

## üß± Existing Infrastructure 
- Using a Free Azure Subscription 
- Owner role already assigned on the subscription. 
- Hub & spoke Network Topology is already configured:
    - *Hub VNet*:  Hosts Cloud Shell (VNet-integrated).
    - *Spoke VNet*: Hosts the AKS Private Cluster.
    - *VNet Peering*: Established between Hub and Spoke VNets.


## ‚ò∏Ô∏è AKS Private Cluster Deployment

- Create a Private AKS cluster with private API server endpoint.

## üîó  Link Hub VNet (VNet where Cloud Shell will be deployed) to Private DNS Zone. 
- Establish a link between Private DNS Zone and VNet where Cloud Shell is deployed to resolve the public FQDN to Private IP.

- Deploy Azure Relay 
- Configure Cloud Shell within the Hub VNet (or VNet of your choice that is peered to AKS VNet)
- Use Cloud Shell to securely connect to the AKS private endpoint

  
## ‚úÖ Connection Verification
Confirm access paths:
From Portal ‚Üí Cloud Shell ‚Üí AKS API
From Remote Site ‚Üí VNet Gateway ‚Üí AKS
From Jump Box ‚Üí AKS
