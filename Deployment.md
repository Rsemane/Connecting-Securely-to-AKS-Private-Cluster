# üöÄ Deployment Flow Overview
This guide outlines the steps to deploy and securely connect to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) private cluster using Cloud Shell with VNet integration, following a hub-and-spoke network topology.

 ## Access Options Flow 
For the purpose of this demonstration, access to the AKS private cluster will be established using Access Option 3.

## üß± Existing Infrastructure 
- Using a Free Azure Subscription 
- Owner role already assigned on the subscription. 
- Hub & spoke Network Topology is already configured:
    - *Hub VNet*:  Hosts Cloud Shell (VNet-integrated).
    - *Spoke VNet*: Hosts the AKS Private Cluster.
    - *VNet Peering*: Established between Hub and Spoke VNets.


## ‚ò∏Ô∏è AKS Private Cluster Deployment

- To deploy the AKS private cluster with a private API server endpoint, follow these steps in the Azure Portal:
1. Navigate to AKS Service   
- [x] Go to the Azure Portal and search for Kubernetes services, then click Create.

2. Configure Basics
Fill in the required fields such as:

- [x] Subscription  
- [x] Resource Group  
- [x] Cluster name   
- [x] Region

3. Click "Next" Until You Reach the Networking Tab    
Proceed through the tabs (Node Pools, Authentication, etc.) until you reach Networking.

4. Enable Private Access
In the Networking tab:

- [x] Check Enable private cluster  
- [x] You can choose to Bring your own Azure Virtual Network if created before. If not you can keep it unchecked, a new Azure Virtual Network will be created.   
- [x] Optionally configure DNS name prefix or leave it to be auto-created.   
- [x] Review + Create

5. Edit the name of Infrastructure Resource Group    
In Advanced tab:   
If you need to modify the name of infrastructure resource group of AKS, click on Edit and change the name.      

7. Click Review + Create, validate the configuration, and then click Create to deploy the cluster.


## üîó  Link Hub VNet (VNet where Cloud Shell will be deployed) to Private DNS Zone. 
- Establish a link between Private DNS Zone and VNet where Cloud Shell is deployed to resolve the public FQDN to Private IP.

- Deploy Azure Relay 
- Configure Cloud Shell within the Hub VNet (or VNet of your choice that is peered to AKS VNet)
- Use Cloud Shell to securely connect to the AKS private endpoint
